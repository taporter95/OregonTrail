  <h1> Trail Info </h1>
  <p>Try taking a journey by covered wagon across 2000 miles
  <br>
  of plains, rivers, and mountains. Try! On the plains will
  <br>
  you slosh your oxen through mud and water-filled ruts or 
  <br>
  will you plod through dust six inches deep
  </p>
  <p>How will you cross the rivers? If you have money take
  <br>
  a ferry (if there is a ferry). Or, you can ford the river
  <br>
  and hope you and your wagon aren't swallowed alive!
  </p>
  <p> What about supplies? Well, if you're low on food
  <br>
  you can fish. Reel in the fish quickly or they'll get away. 
  <br>
  Catch as many as you can!
  </p>
  <p>At South Pass, you can try navigating the Green River,
  <br>
  but if running the rapids with a makeshift raft makes you
  <br>
  queasy, better head to Fort Bridger.
  </p>
  <p>If for some reason you don't survive -- your wagon burns,
  <br>
  or thieves steal your oxen, or you run out of provisions,
  <br>
  or you die of cholera -- don't give up! Try again...and
  <br>
  again... until your name is up with the others on The Oregon Top Ten.
